      <h2>Me in RoboTech</h2>
      <p>I started being part of RoboTech on 2023, the first year of University. I started working on Zeus Project, which mainly consisted on making robotics arms. 
        The following year, I became general Secretary of the asotiation, and I took in charge the first phase of Zeus Project, which was about teaching new students how to work with the easiest parts of the project.
        At the same time, I started working on the phase 3, in which we focused on writing the code in ROS. That same year, with a group of friends from RoboTech and Cosmos (another student asotiaition), we organized an event about robotics and space, called Aerobot.

        <h2>Zeus Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>Zeus project pretends to make a humanoid robot using opensource tools. It is based on the <a href="https://inmoov.fr/" target="_blank">Inmoov project</a>.</p>
            <p>We have used Inmoov work only as far as pieces is concerned, which have been adapted and 3d printed. The software has been fully made by us, whoch firstly includes an "AI" vision software using opencv and python. Now we are working to move that code to ROS.</p>
            <P>To know more about the project, check our github repo.</P>
